## EventScripts
Lua script for Azerothcore with ElunaLUA to debuff players in zones listed in the configuration.

#### Find me on patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Honeys

## Requirements:
Compile your [Azerothcore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) with [Eluna Lua](https://www.azerothcore.org/catalogue-details.html?id=131435473).
The ElunaLua module itself usually doesn't require much setup/config. Just specify the subfolder where to put your lua_scripts in its .conf file.

If the directory was not changed in the ElunaLua config, add the .lua script to your `../lua_scripts/` directory as a subfolder of the worldserver.

## Admin Usage:
Adjust the config flags and IDs in the .lua

## GM Usage:
Nothing to do.

### (healerCompetition.lua)
Nothing to do, watch them trying if you want to.

## Player Usage:
Go to the zone. Have a hard time.
